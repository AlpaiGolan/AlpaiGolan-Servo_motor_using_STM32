Servo Motor Control using STM32 and PWM:

This project demonstrates how to control a servo motor using the STM32 microcontroller and PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signals.

Overview:
A servo motor is a type of motor that allows for precise control of angular position. It is commonly used in robotics, RC vehicles, and automation systems.
Servo motors require a PWM signal to control their position.
In this project, we utilize the STM32 microcontroller's PWM capability to generate the necessary signals to control a servo motor's position.

Components Required:
STM32 microcontroller board (e.g., STM32 Nucleo, STM32 Discovery)
Servo motor
Breadboard
Jumper wires

Circuit Diagram:
Connect the signal pin of the servo motor to one of the PWM-capable pins (e.g., PA0) on the STM32 microcontroller.
Connect the servo motor's power (VCC) and ground (GND) pins to the appropriate power and ground rails on the breadboard.

Setup Instructions:
Connect the components according to the circuit diagram.
Upload the provided firmware code to the STM32 microcontroller using an IDE such as STM32CubeIDE.
Power on the system and observe the servo motor's movement.
